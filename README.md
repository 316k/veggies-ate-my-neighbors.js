Veggies Ate My Neighbors.js
===========================

A fantastic game with mutant vegans trying to conquer the world.

Note that this game is a javascript rewrite of *Veggies Ate My Neighbors*,
which was a Java project for a programming course and is no longer developed.
(why the hell would I want to maintain a Java software)

## Background Story

*April 2017* : The evil agriculture corporation Monsinti runs
an experimental program to crossbreed vegetables and nuclear weapons in
order to generate more robust plant seeds...

*May 2017* : Monsinti's Scientists prematurely declares the experiment as
a success and the resulting seeds are patented and sold to third-world
farmers for a very cheap price.

*January 2018* : Plants grown from Monsinti's patented seeds are used in the
kitchens of a high-class vegan restaurant, and some customers mutate into
cruel and merciless chlorophyll-eating monsters.

Luckily, you happen to have your own personnal stock of flesh-eating
mutant plants that you bought to protect yourself in case of
a zombie apocalypse. Looks like it's time to use it !
